# Kaggle-challenge-team-2

A group assignment where students will participate in a mock Kaggle Challenge. Each team is tasked to develop a statistical/machine learning model and will submit their model results to Kaggle to obtain a score. Teams will also present their findings in a group presentation. Teams will create a collaborative research environment using GitHub and Google Colab, explore and visualize the data, build a pipeline to pre-process the dataset, train a viable model, and customize it.
