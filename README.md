# Kaggle-challenge-team-2

This is Team 2 of Kaggle Challenge, a group assignment conducted at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, where students will participate in a Kaggle competition: [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic). Each team is tasked to develop a statistical/machine learning model and will submit their model results to Kaggle to obtain a score. Teams will also present their findings in a group presentation with a PowerPoint presentation. Teams will create a collaborative research environment using GitHub and Google Colab, explore and visualize the data, build a pipeline to pre-process the dataset, train a viable model, and customize it.

Predict which passengers of The Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner, were transported by a spacetime anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.
