## Project Overview

This is a group assignment where students will participate in a Kaggle competition: [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic). Our task is to develop a statistical/machine learning model to predict which passengers of the Spaceship Titanic were transported by a spacetime anomaly, using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system. We will submit our model results to Kaggle to obtain a score and present our findings in a group presentation.

## Objectives

- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Explore and visualize the dataset.
- **Data Pre-processing**: Build a pipeline to pre-process the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Train and customize a viable model.
- **Collaboration**: Use GitHub and Google Colab for a collaborative research environment.
- **Presentation**: Present our findings in a group presentation with a PowerPoint presentation.
